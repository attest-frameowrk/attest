Aethon Robotics: Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How do AethonBots handle bad weather?
A: AethonBots are rated IP65 for water and dust resistance. They operate
normally in light rain but are recalled to charging stations during heavy
storms or when wind speeds exceed 50 km/h.

status tracking, and webhook notifications. SDKs are available for Python,
TypeScript, and Go.

hardware defects. Extended warranties up to 5 years are available.
